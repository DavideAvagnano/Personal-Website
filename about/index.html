          <h4>Educational Background</h4>
          <p>
            At the age of 23, my unconventional journey led me from aerospace 
            engineering to programming and code writing. After graduating, I chose 
            to discontinue my studies during the master's degree. For two years, I 
            worked as a lifeguard in various settings. This experience taught me the 
            importance of dedication and responsibility, exposing me to significant 
            challenges that shaped my resilient mindset. However, I knew from the 
            start that it was a temporary job, as my interest had shifted to the 
            world of programming.

          <h4>Transition to Coding and Problem-Solving Aptitude</h4>
          <p>
            With a strong aptitude for problem-solving since university days, 
            coding became the tangible expression of my passion. Over time, I've 
            explored various areas, from data analysis, given my university focus on 
            statistics and probability, to web development. I've had the opportunity 
            to get my hands dirty with different programming languages and various 
            related software. I would love to actively engage in the realization of 
            interesting projects that can stimulate me and satisfy my thirst for 
            knowledge.

          <h4>Balanced Lifestyle and Travel Enthusiast</h4>
          <p>
            Advocating for a balanced lifestyle, I incorporate yoga and meditation 
            into my daily routine. Outdoors sports are integral to my life, as the 
            connection with nature is fundamental. Shaped by the influence of a flight 
            attendant parent, travel has always been my way of discovering the world. 
            The allure of the unknown intrigues me, making exploration a 
            central passion.

          <h4>Passion for Finance and Blockchain Technology</h4>
          <p>
            Actively investing in various sectors, from stocks to cryptocurrencies, 
            finance fascinates me. My fascination extends to blockchain technology, 
            leading me to participate in conferences and a Master's program in Rome.
